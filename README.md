# refactoring
my solution to some refactoring katas 

This is a collection of solutions to refactoring katas. Many come from the excellent work of [Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache). [Jim Weirich's take on the Gilded Rose Kata](https://github.com/jimweirich/gilded_rose_kata) is also here.
